# QUESTION 1
# Ruby has a .sort method that makes it easy to sort an array. 
# The goal of this exercise is to implement your own sort from scratch 
# (without using Ruby's #sort method!)

# The approach you will implement is called bubble sort. 
# First you examine the first two items in the array. 
# If the second is smaller than the first, you swap their positions. 
# Then you move on to the next two items and keep repeating. 
# You can see a visual of it in action here: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Bubble-sort-example-300px.gif 

# Your job is to implement a bubble sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. 
# To be clear, you're not allowed to use the built in .sort method.
# Instead you'll write code to go through the array two items at a time 
# to accomplish the same thing.

# To create an array
array = []

# To print an array's contents
puts array

# To push items into an array
array << "hello"

# To select the first item in an array
array = ["Hello", "Bye"]

puts array[0]

# THis is where I am stuck on this problem. After having my array with numbers in it, I will write my sort method that will push the
# bubble-sorted array into a second array. I will come back and correct this after turning this version in after looking up how to complete this.
