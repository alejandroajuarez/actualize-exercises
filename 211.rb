# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

# For the following problems, I was able to solve these from memory. The only one that I was a tad confused on was 'upcase'. I thought it was either
# 'uppercase' or 'capitalize' but I also knew the method was a bit funny looking and it made sense once I saw the answer and redid the problem
# from scratch.

# For the next skills I will be working on tomorrow, I will be completing 7 - 10 in the variables1 branch. I do not want to rush these and would
# like to take my time so i can make sure they are solidified in my mind like it was explained in the overview video, about not crunching all
# of the exercises.

# Write a program that uses a variable to store a word, then prints that word in reverse order.

word = "Heisenberg Titanic Hindenburg"
puts word.reverse

# Write a program that uses a variable to store a number, then prints the number times 10.

number = 2
puts number * 10

# Write a program that uses variables to store two words, then prints both words on the same line in all capital letters.

word1 = "Hello"
word2 = " James"

puts word1.upcase + word2.upcase
