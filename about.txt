My name is Alejandro Juarez. I’m 28 years old, a recent graduate of Capella University with a Bachelor’s degree in IT specializing in Software Development, and a proud 
United States Marine Corps veteran. I’m an avid gamer, traveler, and tech enthusiast, always staying on top of the latest in software and hardware innovations. Currently, 
I work as an AutoCAD drafter for the government as a contractor, but I’m eager to transition into a career in software development. My primary interests lie in full-stack web development 
and application development. Since childhood, I’ve dreamed of creating my own video game—a goal I know many share. While I realize this program isn’t specifically geared toward 
game development, I believe it will provide me with the foundational skills and knowledge I need to excel in software development and bring my own projects to life.
I’m a strong advocate for in-person learning, so adjusting to online education has been a challenge. That’s one of the reasons I chose Actualize—its virtual calls simulate the 
collaborative atmosphere of an in-person classroom, which I find invaluable. I’m excited about what the next few months with Actualize have in store and can’t wait to 
dive into this journey toward achieving my goals.
