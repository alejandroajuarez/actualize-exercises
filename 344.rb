# QUESTION 1
# Given an integer, write a method to return its roman numeral representation.
# (1 is I, 2 is II, 3 is III, 4 is IV, 5 is V, 6 is VI, 7 is VII, etc.)
# (You can see an example of all the rules here: https://byjus.com/maths/roman-numerals/#chart)

# How to ask for a users input
puts "Please type in a number"

# How to get a users input
input = gets.chomp

# Without looking anything up, I am unsure of the type of loop I would need to use for this type of problem. I think that I'd need a sort of 'for each'
# loop but I am not sure. In that instance I would say that for each specific number entered, give an output of a roman numeral. I feel very
# stuck on this problem off the top of my head.
